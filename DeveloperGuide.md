# Developer Guidelines

## Installation

To get started, clone the repo:
`$ git@github.com:linqiu0-0/DubLease.git`

## Start Developing
### Start containers
Use the `docker-compose` tool from the root directory to start both the backend and frontend containers, :
1. Fisrt build the system through `docker compose build `
2. Then run the system through`docker compose up`
   
Now, you should be getting logs from both the express server/backend and the webpack-dev-server that serves the frontend.

If you have any errors with docker, please launch frontend and backend service separately follow the rest tutorial.

# Frontend
DubLease frontend uses the React framework with javascript. 
The UI design for the frontend is based on this [Fimga Design](https://www.figma.com/file/8Ivetl62l7CELx0hTaaq1N/Dub-Lease?node-id=0%3A1&t=QWbdjKd0nRIM1hva-1).
